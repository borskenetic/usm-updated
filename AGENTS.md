# AGENTS.md - pantas-v2.5

Laravel 12 library management backend (Pantas v2.6 line). **Mobile API owner** for Pantas-UI.

Remote: `https://github.com/zypheus/Pantas-v2.6.git`

Run all commands from this directory (`pantas-v2.5/`).

## Stack

- PHP 8.2+, Laravel 12, Sanctum
- Blade + Tailwind 4 + Flowbite + Alpine
- Vite for `resources/js` and `resources/css`
- **New UI:** use daisyUI skill (`.agents/skills/daisyui/`)

## Key Paths

- `app/Http/Controllers/` - request handling
- `app/Models/` - Eloquent models
- `database/migrations/` - schema changes
- `database/seeders/` - seed data (including MARC/catalog)
- `documentation/architecture-migration-plan.md` - canonical architecture migration plan
- `documentation/TASK.MD` - current task tracker, milestones, backlog, and discoveries
- `resources/views/` - Blade templates
- `routes/web.php` - web routes
- `routes/api.php` - mobile API under `/api/mobile`
- `tests/` - PHPUnit tests

Legacy static files (`about.html`, `style.css`, etc.) exist at repo root. Prefer Laravel routes, Blade, and Vite assets for new work.

## Required Planning Context

Before planning or implementing any architecture, role, route, migration, attendance, library, mobile API, dashboard, or patron workflow change, read:

1. `documentation/architecture-migration-plan.md`
2. `documentation/TASK.MD`

Treat these files as the current source of truth for the separated Attendance + Library migration. Keep `documentation/TASK.MD` updated when work starts, subtasks change, new risks are discovered, or milestones are completed.

Always ask clarifying questions before implementation when context, desired behavior, migration scope, data ownership, route compatibility, mobile API contracts, frontend direction, role permissions, or workflow rules are not fully specified. Do not proceed from assumptions on these topics.

If a user asks to implement a task from the migration plan, first restate the target milestone/subtask, identify the files likely to change, list any open questions, and wait for confirmation when the change affects schema, roles, module access, attendance logs, library attendance logs, mobile API contracts, patron registration, circulation, fines, room reservations, or reports.

## Mobile API

Pantas-UI consumes `/api/mobile` (Sanctum auth). When changing API contracts, check:

- `routes/api.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Mobile/` (or equivalent mobile controllers)
- Pantas-UI `lib/services/` and `lib/core/config/api_config.dart`

## Local Setup

```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=MarcFrameworkSeeder
php artisan storage:link
```

## Common Commands

```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
composer run dev
npm run build
php artisan test --filter=SomeTest
./vendor/bin/pint
php artisan route:list
```

## Frontend Guidance

- Match existing Blade + Tailwind + Flowbite style before introducing new patterns.
- Reuse `resources/views/components/sidebar-nav.blade.php` in the authenticated shell.
- Brand colors: `brand-navy`, `brand-gold`, `brand-green`.
- For new Tailwind UI, follow the **daisyUI** skill. Do not use shadcn here.

## Coding Standards

- Prefer Eloquent, Form Requests, policies, named routes, and migrations.
- Keep controllers thin. Use transactions for circulation, fines, registrations, and reservations.
- Preserve existing route names and view contracts unless a breaking change is requested.
- Do not add packages without strong reason.

## Verification

```bash
php -l path/to/file.php
php artisan test --filter=RelevantTest
php artisan route:list
./vendor/bin/pint
npm run build
```
